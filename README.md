# DFX Hello World using React Js

This project uses Dfinity v-0.9.3 and React v-18.2.0.

This serves as a template for rapid DFX and React integration.

For Detailed step by step guide follow this [link](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/frontend/custom-frontend).

Some changes have been made in the repo as compared to the official docs inorder to have the frontend work with an older version of dfinity. 

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica,
dfx start

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
